
 *** I would recommend before you take the PC to the greehouse check if everything is working properly in the lab first. Connect the pc to one of the screens in the lab, check if it is connected to wifi, and do a simple test with realvnc like connecting o it while in the lab because sometimes realvnc is not enabled.

USING VNC :

    * Open open Realvnc viewer on your pc
    * on your homepage open DESKTOP-JSQ8FQ9
    * wait for a moment
    * if everything is working properly you will see the normal home page for windows requiring you to type in password
    * type in the password and press enter
    * to start moving the gantry open Arduino IDE on desktop 
    * go to tools menu of the arduino and select board and choose Arduino/Genuino Mega or Mega 2560
    * go to tools menu again and select port and choose a port that has arduino mega name in it
    * after that open Serial monitor and use special keys for controlling the gantry refer to Keys to Drive the Gantry.doc in this folder 
    * remember keys are in small letter and place enter after each key entered in the serial monitor

Taking picture with athe camera:

    * turn on the camera
    * make sure the camera is in the P mode 
    * connect the USB from the camera to the PC
    * Open EOS Utility application on desktop
    * Open Camera settings/Remote shooting 
    * you will see a small window open 
    * to view what the camera is seeing look down the opened window you will see a rectangle shaped button called live view shoot
    * to take picture click on round button on the top
