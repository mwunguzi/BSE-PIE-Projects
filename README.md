# Embedded Engineer Intern Projects
Welcome to the repository containing three projects I worked on during my time as an embedded engineer intern. Each project highlights different aspects of embedded systems development and demonstrates my skills in this field.

## Project 1: Gantry Robot for Imaging and Sensing
##Description
The Gantry Robot for Imaging and Sensing project involved developing a gantry robot system for imaging and sensing applications. The gantry robot is equipped with motors to control the movement of the gantry and trolley to controle the movemnt of the camera attachment. I worked on the microcontroller programming to precisely control the speed of AC motors for smooth and accurate movement of the gantry and trolley.

##Features
* Precise control of AC motors for smooth movement.
* Integration of sensors for imaging and sensing applications.
* Gantry system for precise positioning of sensors.
  
##Technologies Used
* Microcontroller (Arduino, STM32)
* AC motor control & VFD
* Sensors for imaging and sensing
  
## Project 2: Soil Erosion Monitoring System
##Description
The Soil Erosion Monitoring System project focused on developing a setup using Arduino microcontrollers to monitor soil erosion. The system includes sensors to detect erosion levels and record data onto an SD card. This data can be analyzed to study soil erosion patterns over time.

##Features
* Real-time monitoring of soil erosion levels.
* Data logging onto an SD card for offline analysis.
* Arduino-based setup for affordability and flexibility.
  
##Technologies Used
* Arduino microcontroller
* Soil erosion sensors
* SD card module

  
##Project 3: Greenhouse Temperature Datalogger
##Description
The Greenhouse Temperature Datalogger project aimed to create a datalogger system to record greenhouse temperature. The system includes sensors to measure temperature inside the greenhouse. Temperature readings are saved both locally onto an SD card as a backup and transmitted to the cloud for remote monitoring and analysis.

##Features
* Real-time monitoring of greenhouse temperature.
* Data logging on both local SD card and cloud storage.
* Remote access for monitoring and analysis.
  
##Technologies Used
* Microcontroller (Arduino)
* Temperature sensors
* SD card module
* Cloud connectivity (MQTT, HTTP)
  
##Usage
Each project directory contains detailed documentation, including setup instructions, hardware requirements, and code explanations. Feel free to explore the projects and adapt them to your own applications.
